Causality as clarifier: Examples from Earth science
==========================================================================

There has been a ton of recent work attempting to "discover" causal
structure from data in Earth science (Jakob Runge's [review
paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10105-3) gives a
nice summary).

However this project looks at causality through a very different lens
and examines how causal graphs, a fundamental from causal theory, can
be used to clarify assumptions, identify tractable problems, and aid
interpreation of results in Earth science research.
