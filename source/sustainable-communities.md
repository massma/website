### Sustainable communities


* What is the role of technology in self-sustaining communities?
* How much of an outside resource investment is required to build a
  self-sustaining community?
* How does community size impact resilience, resource investment and
  technologies used?
* How is self-sustaining defined?
* What are the possible roles of nomadic lifestyles?

This a new area that I'm interested in thinking and learning more
