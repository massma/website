The Communal Climate Machine (CCM)
==========================================================================

The goal of this project is to build a tool that:

1. Allows any collaborators to add and query knowledge on climate-life
   (humans, plants, animals, etc.) interaction . Collaborators can be
   anyone (e.g., scientists, activists, politicians, students,
   teachers, parents, farmers, sailors, musicians, artists, etc.).

To accomplish this, the system must:

1. Be "additive": any collaborator should be able to add their content
   without worry about how it might conflict or break exisitng code.
2. Must be capable of acknowling that when it comes to humans, there
   is no one "true" world view: we should be able to manage different
   sets of assumptions and world views that are mutually consistent
   but also contractictory: the goal is to reach some deeper communal
   understanding by aknowledging and analyzing our collective and
   diverse worldviews.
