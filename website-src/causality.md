Causality for clarification: Examples from climate science
==========================================================================

There has been a ton of recent work attempting to "discover" causal
structure from data in climate science (Jakob Runge and coauthors'
[review paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10105-3)
gives a nice summary).

However this project looks at causality through a very different lens
and examines how causal graphs[^5], a fundamental from causal theory,
can be used to clarify assumptions, identify tractable problems, and
aid interpretation of results in climate research. The goal is to
[distill](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) the basics of the
graphical approach to causality in a way that is relatable for climate
scientists.

#### A causal graph is a diagram

To build a causal graph, a researcher draws arrows from causes to
affected variables. Here is a toy (simplified) example involving
sunlight (at the earth's surface), clouds, and aerosols[^1]:

![A toy example of a causal graph](dot/cloud-aerosol.png)

From a young age we know that clouds reduce sunlight (arrow from cloud
to sunlight). Aerosols also reduce sunlight by reflecting it back to
space (arrow from aerosol to sunlight), and they impact clouds by
providing a surface for water vapor in the air to condense/deposit
onto (arrow from aerosol to cloud). These diagrams are very intuitive
for many domain scientists to draw, but they also have a formal
mathematical meaning with rigorous underlying theory[^2]. The fun part
is we can use this theory to play all sorts of games.

#### Applications of causal graph theory

One of the powers of causal graphs' underlying theory is that we can
automatically analyze (from the graph) which variables we need to
control for in order to calculate a causal effect, and whether
calculating a causal effect is even possible.

Returning to our toy example may help here as well: consider a
situation where we have observations of cloud and sunlight, and we
want to calculate our expectation for how much sunlight would decrease
if we intervened ("played god" in the modeling sense) and added clouds
on a sunny day. If we naively just bin data by cloudy and clear days,
and calculate the difference in sunlight between each type of day:

![A naive approach to calculating a "causal"
effect](fig/naiveCloudSunlight.png)

We find that the average decrease in sunlight on cloudy days is about
160 W/m$^2$ [^3]. However, because we drew a causal graph we can
analyze if we need to control for any variables in order to calculate
the true causal effect of adding a cloud to our sunny day. Details are
in the paper, but if we do this we find that we need to control for
aerosol. Controlling for aerosol with regression (again details are in
the paper):

![Calculating an effect by controlling for aerosol](fig/cloudSunlight.png)

results in a causal effect of cloud decreasing sunlight by 68.5
W/m$^2$, much less than our original estimate of 160 W/m$^2$. This
toy example was done on generated rather than real data, so we know
the "true" causal effect, which is 68 W/m$^2$. So if we do not
adjust for aerosol, we get a very wrong estimate of our causal effect,
but if we do, we are very close to the truth!

Further, if we were confronted with a scenario where we don't have
access to aerosol observations, we would not be able to calculate the
causal effect, no matter how many samples of cloud and sunlight were
available. In this way, we can analyze our causal graphs in light of
available observations to determine whether calculating a causal
effect is possible before we have to deal with any tedious (and time
consuming) collection or downloading of data!

To summarize, causal graphs allow us to:

1. Communicate in an intuitive way our assumptions about dependencies
   between variables in a system.
2. Automatically analyze which variables we must control for to lend a
   causal (rather then correlational) interpretation to our analysis.
3. Filter out tractable vs intractable causal questions before we
   spend a lot of time analyzing data.

However, even if a causal interpretation is impossible given our
graph, we think it is still very useful to draw a causal graph and
present it with the research. It still communicates the researchers'
assumptions about how the system works, and communication is hard
enough as it is, so we should use as many tools as we can.
Readers/viewers can use the graph to analyze for themselves the
possible sources of confounding and co-variation that could not be
accounted for in the analysis, and reason about what their impact may
have been (for example: large or small; positive or negative). **A
causal graph can aid communication and interpretation even if the
analysis is not causal.**

#### Moving beyond toys

Toy examples are useful for understanding, but are causal graphs
useful for real applications? To answer, I went back to an an old
[field
campaign](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/student/massmann/ccope.html) I
was a part of at UAlbany. We were trying to estimate the effect of
rain regime[^4] on rainfall patterns in the Nahuelbuta mountains in
Chile. Here is a graph for that system:

![Graph for the
[CCOPE](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/student/massmann/ccope.html) field
campaign](dot/ccope.png)

The details of what everything means aren't that important. What is
important is that it is impossible or too expensive to observe
everything (any variable with a dashed circle is unobserved), but if
we analyze the graph in terms of what we did observe during the
campaign, we find that **we can calculate the causal effect of rain
regime on mountain rainfall**, which was the goal of the project. This
comes as no surprise to me, because the designers of the campaign
([Ren√© Garreaud](http://www.dgf.uchile.cl/rene/), [Justin
Minder](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/jminder/), [Jefferson
Snider](https://www.uwyo.edu/atsc/directory/faculty/snider/index.html
), and [David Kingsmill](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E36Kp50AAAAJ&hl=en)) are atmospheric science wizards. However the causal graph is nice
because it **proves** in some sense that, subject to the clear
assumptions in the graph, the design of **the field campaign was
sound**.

This example demonstrates how causal graphs can communicate
assumptions and lend a mathematically justified causal interpretation
to real problems in climate. Such a causal graph could be included in
any field campaign proposal, improving communication about the system
and also rigorously justifying the campaign's observations as
necessary for calculating an effect. Even before the proposal, we
could start with a causal graph, and then analyze the causal graph to
determine which observations we need to meet our campaign's
goals. Building on this idea, we could attach costs to observing
different variables, and automatically determine the set of
observations that minimizes cost while still allowing us to calculate
our effect of interest. This type of prior analysis could be something
to consider on any future field proposal.

This is just one example to show that graphs can be useful in real
applications, but there are many more possibilities. The most
important point (and I know I'm getting repetitive but I want to
hammer it home) is that causal graphs are useful for communicating
assumptions and structuring/organizing analyses.

#### Final words

That was way longer than I expected; apologies. Despite the length I
glossed over or neglected a bunch of important details. We should have
a paper with all of these details up on the
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) soon; I am just wrinkling out some final
details in the presentation with my collaborators. If you want a copy
of the draft, just send me an email (akm2203@columbia.edu).

Finally, the big takeaway is to consider **drawing a causal graph as a
first step in your next project; it might help clarify a lot**.

[^5]: [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html)'s
    bibliography is a good place for a deep dive into a lot of the
    theory. Personally I found that Cosma Shalizi's
    [textbook](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/) (Chapters
    19-22) provide a concise, clear, and accessible introduction.

[^1]: "aerosols" are tiny particles that float in the air.

[^2]: one of my biggest regrets is that I did not learn about causal
    graphs until I was a Ph.D. student. I would have loved a math
    class growing up where we were encouraged to draw diagrams for
    complicated problems, and then view these as valid mathematical
    objects/answers themselves. I think there is a lot of opportunity
    for causal graphs in K-12 education, but I am not super up on that
    field so maybe people are already introducing them.

[^3]: W/m$^2$ is a measure of the amount of sunlight. It has units of
    energy per unit time, per a square meter of the Earth's surface.

[^4]: These rain regimes were microphysical, which in this case just
    means we were interested in whether ice falling into
    rain clouds would change patterns of rainfall.
