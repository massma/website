* Required software
 - [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]]
 - [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Haskell Stack]]
 - texlive
 - emacs

* Build instructions
** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack build && stack exec build
   #+END_SRC

** GNU/Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack build && stack exec build
   #+END_SRC

   or, with GNU Make:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 make
   #+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.
