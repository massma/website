* Required software
 - [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]]
 - [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Haskell Stack]]
 - [[https://shakebuild.com/][Shake Build System]] (installable with Stack)
* Build instructions
** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack exec ./build.bat
#+END_SRC

** GNU/Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack exec ./build.sh
#+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.
