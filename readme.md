Required software
=================

-   [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
-   [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
-   [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
-   [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
-   [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
-   miscellaneous Linux utilities (e.g., `sed`)

Build instructions
==================

GNU/Linux instructions
----------------------

Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

``` {.bash}
make
```

This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven\'t tested it.

Windows (unsupported for now- help needed)
------------------

Any Windows wizards please reach out - I'd love to have build
instructions for Windows but I don't know how (or if) Make, sh, and
CLI utilities work on Windows.
