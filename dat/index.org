   I am a Ph.D. student in environmental engineering, advised by
   [[https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people/pierre-gentine][Pierre Gentine]] at Columbia University. I study *human-land-climate
   interactions* by merging *physical or conceptual models* with
   *observational data*.

*** Resources (mostly for fellow students)

    The origins of each of these pages are responses to email
    questions. After writing the same email a few times I decided to
    just put them on the web for easy linking, and in case they are
    useful to the public.
