The Communal Climate Consciousness (CCC)
==========================================================================

The goal of this project is to build a tool that **allows any
collaborator to add and query knowledge on climate-life
interaction**. Life includes humans, plants, animals, etc., and
collaborators can be anyone (scientists, activists, students,
teachers, family, farmers, writers, sailors, artists, etc.).

To accomplish this, the system should:

1. Be "additive": any collaborator should be able to add their content
   without worrying about how it might conflict or break existing
   code. (this way no one has to learn a big complicated system just
   to add a new idea to it.)
2. Be capable of acknowledging that when it comes to humans, there is
   no one "true" world view: we should be able to manage different
   sets of assumptions and world views that are mutually consistent
   but also contradictory. (this also helps with "additive"-ity.)
3. Present results to queries in a way that is accessible and
   understandable, but also allows us to easily examine how our
   results change as a function of the world view we believe is true:
   the goal is to reach some deeper communal understanding by
   acknowledging and analyzing our collective and diverse worldviews.

I am currently working to build such a system for a test case: the
impact of soil water and atmospheric dryness on plant function (water
loss, photosynthesis). This is a useful test because it involves
climate-life (plant) interaction, and it is also an area of study with
a lot of contradictory results and uncertainty. So this example case
should really test our ability to encode and analyze contradictory
assumptions and world views, but it is focused enough to be
tractable. It is also personally useful because at some point I need
to put together a coherent dissertation, and it connects directly to
previous [writing](vpd-et.md).

Even though the test case is still work in progress, I **really
strongly encourage anyone even the slightest bit interested in this
project to reach out to me**, either through email
(akm2203@columbia.edu) or a [Github
issue](https://github.com/massma/website/issues/2) (public). My goal
is to bring as many people in as early as possible so we can come up
with a design together.

A lot of this work is built on ideas from Alexey Radul's
[Ph.D. thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54635) and
research on truth maintenance systems (Ken Forbus's textbook "Building
problem solvers" seems like a good reference, although I have not had
time yet to fully dive in). Also the "[Supporting Domain-Specific
Inquiry with Rule-Based
Modeling](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/poem/projects#h.p_Wk0l1pdCVrrw)"
project at [Chris
Martens](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/cmartens)'s
[POEM](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/poem/home) lab seems to have
a ton of overlap in goals. (Understanding more about the logic
approach this project takes is high up on my to-do list). If anyone
knows of any other overlapping projects let me know, and if you work
in this area and want to get involved please please reach out! I am
not a computer scientist and could really use the help...
