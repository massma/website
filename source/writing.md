Writing resources
-----------------

Writing is always a struggle for me but I am trying to get better. For
convenience, I gathered the resources that helped me, but writing is
very subjective so they may not be generally useful:

-   [\"How to write a great research paper\" by Simon
    Peyton-Jones](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/slides/peyton-jones.pdf).
    Biggest takeaway for me: writing is a method for **doing research**
    rather than just **communicating research**. Start writing right
    away; just a research idea is usually enough to start on an
    introduction (I really wish that I came across this earlier in my
    Ph.D...)\
    A video of the presentation is also [hosted by
    Microsoft.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/)
-   [\"Good Writing\" by Marc
    Raibert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/Randy/Randy/raibert.htm) :
    general advice on how to become a strong writer.
-   \"Furor Scribendi\" by Octavia Butler : advice for aspiring
    professional writers that resonates for amateurs too. Shares ideas
    with Marc Raibert above (e.g., \"good\" writing starts \"bad\"), but
    also discusses the importance of habit and persistence. \"Furor
    Scribendi\" is under copyright, but it is published as part of the
    anthology \"[Bloodchild and Other
    Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodchild_and_Other_Stories),\"
    which can be picked up at most libraries.
-   [\"Dissertation Advice\" by Olin
    Shivers](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/diss-advice.html) :
    specific to dissertations
-   George Orwell\'s 6 rules, which are very subjective so take them or
    leave them. (I happen to like them, but that is personal
    preference.):
    1.  Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which
        you are used to seeing in print.
    2.  Never use a long word where a short one will do.
    3.  If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
    4.  Never use the passive where you can use the active.
    5.  Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word
        if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
    6.  Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright
        barbarous.
-   Many universities have writing centers ([including
    Columbia](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/uwp/writing-center))
    that host office hours and consultations: get help from
    professionals!
