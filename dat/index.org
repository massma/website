** Adam Massmann's home

   I am a Ph.D. student in environmental engineering, advised by
   [[https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people/pierre-gentine][Pierre Gentine]] at Columbia University. I study *human-land-climate
   interactions* by merging *physical or conceptual models* with
   *observational data*.

*** Research
    - [[file:vpd-et.html][Does atmospheric drying increase or reduce evapotranspiration?]]
    - Previous: [[file:masters-research.html][Master's Research (UAlbany)]] in mesoscale meteorology

*** Teaching

    My goal for teaching is to shift education as far as possible
    towards a collaboration between students and teachers where there
    is a two way dialog and everyone works together to learn and
    spread knowledge.  I think technology can help; for example the
    software industry has developed some really great collaboration
    tools built upon version control (e.g. [[https://github.com/][Github]] and [[https://gitlab.com/][Gitlab]]).

    - [[https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/][Git for course deployment and websites]] - a workshop on how to
      use [[https://github.com/][Github]] as a tool to deploy course websites and materials,
      and allow students, professors, and TAs to collaborate on
      improving course materials. I put this together with funding
      from and collaboration with Columbia's [[https://ctl.columbia.edu/][Center for Teaching and
      Learning]].

*** Resources (mostly for fellow students)

    The origins of each of these pages are responses to email
    questions. After writing the same email more than once I decided
    to just put them on the web for easy linking, and in case they are
    useful to the public.
