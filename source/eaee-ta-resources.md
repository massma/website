EAEE Graduate Student Resources
-------------------------------

This website hosts documentation for EAEE graduate students and TAs. The
website is provided for EAEE students, by EAEE students

Please browse the website for links to general documentation for
graduate students and TAs, as well as course-specific documentation for
TAs. If you have any questions or comments, or notice any errors, please
reach out to Adam (uni: akm2203).

**Contributions are enthusiastically encouraged!** A good first
contribution is to add your name and contact information to the
[EAEE-PhD-Student-Resources](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G9RP-Xpefz0XbgiVjvUEUR8BPmGeOqkGRgEAM-SHsbk)
document. Please feel free to add comments or content to any and all
Google Docs/Drive folders!

### General EAEE Graduate Student resources (not TA-specific)

-   [2020 EAEE Ph.D. Orientation
    Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-cW1Rgtk-prQiiB6mQUxH6fGwDnEpbnf/view?usp=sharing) -
    put together by Chae (thanks!): thorough documentation on Ph.D.
    program requirements, teaching, and funding opportunities.
-   [EAEE Working Orientation
    Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15XLTX804nb2GqjX6Kyi9Y8hvwzYY8rXKRRRxKpaKTIQ/edit) -
    this is the place to document changes to the program, and also the
    source of the most up to date information on program requirements.
    Every year, updated orientation slides will be built from this
    document.
-   [EAEE PhD Student
    Resources](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G9RP-Xpefz0XbgiVjvUEUR8BPmGeOqkGRgEAM-SHsbk) -
    contact information of EAEE graduate students, as well as general
    resources for students.
-   [EAEE Ph.D. Resource
    Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16vFLRhV8zds_UYv3W_SXswAD45no8QEu) -
    folder for any materials that do not fit into the above Google Doc.
-   [EAEE Graduate Student Inclusion and Anti-Racism
    Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIPLfSkA6XfdMGeDzCCie-P64uCCdM9KRt-2Kk65opE/edit?usp=sharing) -
    resources on combatting racism and bias, and promoting inclusion
    within EAEE.
-   [EAEE observed and experienced acts of
    exclusion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdR1lVWkQGeObLfnAO-PTuud9QCJEtHjJwfovjQGg-ejh5Mew/viewform?usp=sf_link) -
    an anonymous form to report any observed or experienced acts of
    exclusion. If you wish, one of Ian, Kinnari, Chae, or Adam will talk
    to the people causing the exclusion, with the goal of correcting in
    in the future. We want EAEE\'s impact to match its intention of
    being an inclusive community. Also, if anonymity is not important to
    you, and/or you would like to discuss in person, you can reach out
    to Ian (ihb2106), Kinnari (kms2313), Chae (cj2563), and/or Adam
    (akm2203) directly to talk.

Origins of this website and TA resources
----------------------------------------

This website was originally put together by the participants of a
[Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.columbia.edu/)-sponsored
workshop on TA documentation. The original workshop website is available
at
<http://www.columbia.edu/~akm2203/eaee-ta-resources-workshop-version.html>
if you want more information.

### Repository TO-DO list

-   Think of a catchy name for these resources. \"EAEE Graduate Student
    Resources\" isn\'t drawing anyone in!
-   (at some point) Pass this repository on when Adam graduates. Ian
    volunteered to take it over (thanks Ian!).
-   Once we are all back in Mudd, create a department library where we
    share books. Also include an undergraduate textbook section and give
    the undergrads access. (thanks Ian!).
-   Communally (through feedback or otherwise) refine & redesign the
    website, streamlining as needed

### General EAEE TA resources (not course-specific)

-   [EAEE General TA
    Resources](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11CtnP6b9XiIIkwqhN-H3P8evJnZzAOfNNfc6MnvpOmk) -
    document of general ideas and resources for TAs.
-   [EAEE General TA
    Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11zI63C5Vvl85B4pWQBX0SRVLIgYsPb0J) -
    a place to upload any stand alone documents or materials.

### Contributing guidelines for course-specific materials

To protect materials, course-specific documentation has restricted
permissions to those that are currently or have previously been TAs of
the course. If you cannot access materials that you should have
permission for, just email Adam (uni: akm2203) and he will fix it. Maybe
even more importantly, if you somehow discover that you have access to
materials that you should not have permission to, please contact Adam
immediately so he can fix it.

For file uploads to the Google Drive folder in course-specific
repositories, please add a dated prefix to the filename of the form
\"YYYY-Semester-filename.extension.\" Please **do not include any
spaces** in the filename. For example, if I was uploading a picture of
the first midterm solutions for Fall of 2019 I would call the file:

\"2019-Fall-midterm1-solutions.jpg\"

Or if I was uploading a pdf of the first Problem Set for a course in
Spring of 2020, I would call the file:

\"2020-Spring-ps1.pdf\"

Please reach out to Adam (uni: akm2203) if you have any questions.

If you already have a course repository hosted on another platform like
Github or Dropbox, you can continue to host the repository on that
platform. Just add a Google document to the Google drive folder with a
link to the external repository and instructions for how to obtain
access/edit permissions.

### Ideas of course-specific materials to Document

-   **Contact information**
-   **TA responsibilities and weekly time spent on each responsibility
    (on average)**. The department does not tell TAs how much time they
    will spend on a course. Documenting how much time you spent (on
    average) as a TA is a way for future TAs to get an idea of how much
    time they will spend, so they can plan accordingly.
-   **Solutions to problem sets and exams**, and any other answer keys.
    Many TAs needlessly repeat work by generating the same set of
    solutions as previous years\' TAs.
-   **Grading rubrics**. Grading rubrics make the grading process more
    efficient, help mediate grading disagreements with students, and
    improve course consistency year-to-year. Creating grading rubrics
    can save you time, and adding them to the course repository can save
    future TAs time.
-   **Learning Objectives**. Learning objectives are what you hope
    students will gain from a course, lesson, or problem set. Defining
    learning objectives before making assessments and lessons can help
    make sure course elements are working in service of the learning
    objectives (this is called \"backwards design\").
-   **Revised problem sets and lab activities**. Consider revising
    problem sets again *after* grading for the benefit of next year\'s
    TAs. For example, if an ambiguous question created issues during
    grading, revise the question to be less ambiguous and post it to the
    repository.
-   **Course notes, lecture slides and syllabus.** Self explanatory, but
    documenting can save future TAs time, and improve the quality of the
    course through iterative refinement.
-   **Student FAQ (and answers)**. Many students ask the same questions;
    documenting the answers to those questions can save future TAs the
    time needed to re-craft the same answers. Also through iteration we
    can improve the answers to frequently asked questions year after
    year.
-   **Course specific recommended boundaries.** Setting clear boundaries
    is important for the mental health of both TAs and students.
    Providing a list of boundaries that made the course run smoother can
    help future TAs\' courses run smoother (e.g., only ask questions
    over Piazza instead of email, only answer questions during certain
    times of the day like 9-5, etc.).
-   **Recommendations for successfully working with/for course
    professors**. Every person is different and has their own management
    and organization styles. As we work with someone through the
    semester, we learn the best way to work with them given their style.
    Documenting how you improved your working relationship can help
    future TAs successfully work with faculty.
