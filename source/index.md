---------------------

**Update**: In June 2022 I successfully defended my thesis. I am
currently working with [Keta Waters](https://ketawaters.com/).

From 2016-2022 I was a Ph.D. student in environmental engineering,
advised by [Pierre
Gentine](https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people/pierre-gentine) at
Columbia University. I studied **human-land-climate interactions** by
merging **physical or conceptual models** with **observational
data**. Most of the materials on this website are from my time as a
student.

### Research and Projects

- [Causality for clarification: examples from climate science](causality.md)
- [Does atmospheric drying increase or reduce
    evaporation?](vpd-et.md)
- Previous: [Master\'s Research (UAlbany)](masters-research.md) in
    mesoscale meteorology

### Teaching

-   [Considering the Whole Self in Teaching and
    Learning](teacher-learner-wellbeing/index.html) - a two part
    "[Learning
    Community](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/ctlgrads-learning-communities/)"
    developed in collaboration with [Abby
    Schroering](https://theatre-phd.columbia.edu/people/abby-schroering/). The
    focus is on centering teacher and learner wellbeing in the
    classroom. We emphasized breaking down false notions of mind-body
    dualism and embracing embodied teaching/learning as a way to
    center wellbeing (and improve learning). The vast majority of the
    credit goes to Abby who really made both the collaboration and
    learning community thrive.\ **Update**: Abby and I gave this
    workshop again [in Spring of 2021 through the CIRTL
    network](https://www.cirtl.net/events/943).

-   [Git for course deployment and
    websites](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/) - a
    workshop on how to use [Github](https://github.com/) as a tool to:
    1.  deploy course websites and materials, and
    2.  allow students, professors, and TAs to collaborate on improving
        course materials.

Both these workshops were funded and supported by Columbia\'s [Center
for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.columbia.edu/).
