### Master\'s Projects at UAlbany (mesoscale meteorology)

1.  Lake-effect Snow

    While at UAlbany I focused on using numerical experiments to improve
    our understanding of lake-effect snowstorms (LES). LES occur when
    cold air crossing the relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes
    generate powerful storms under synoptic conditions usually
    associated with fair weather. A newsworthy example of this
    phenomenon was the
    [Buffalo](http://www.weather.gov/buf/lake1415_stormb.html) snowstorm
    of Nov. 17-21, 2014 that dropped up to 2 meters of snow and shut
    down the city.

    Under the advisement of [Dr. Justin
    Minder](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/jminder/), I created a
    semi-idealized modeling framework for studying LES. This involved
    stripping all unnecessary model complexities while still preserving
    the necessary dynamics to resolve LES. Simplified initial and
    boundary conditions allowed me to manipulate model state space in a
    controlled manner and test specific hypotheses.

    I made a poster explaining initial lake-effect snow results for the
    [16th Conference on Mesoscale
    Processes](https://www2.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/meetings-events/ams-meetings/16th-conference-on-mesoscale-processes/).
    Poster available [here](doc/MassmannMesoscale.pdf).

2.  Orographic Rain

    A secondary research interest was orographically enhanced rain in
    coastal mountain ranges. From 5/17/2015 - 8/24/2015 I was in Chile
    conducting an exploratory field campaign (Chilean Coastal Orographic
    Precipitation Experiment pilot project, CCOPE-15) in the Nahuelbuta
    Mountains to the south of Concepción. UAlbany collaborated with
    researchers at the University of Colorado, University of Wyoming,
    Universidad de Chile, and Universidad de Concepción to observe the
    kinematic and microphysical aspects of landfalling storms.
