Adam Massmann\'s home
---------------------

I am a Ph.D. student in environmental engineering, advised by [Pierre
Gentine](https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people/pierre-gentine) at
Columbia University. I study **human-land-climate interactions** by
merging **physical or conceptual models** with **observational data**.

-   [CV](cv/massmann-cv.html) \[[pdf](cv/massmann-cv.pdf)\]

### Research

-   [Does atmospheric drying increase or reduce
    evapotranspiration?](vpd-et.html)
-   Previous: [Master\'s Research (UAlbany)](masters-research.html) in
    mesoscale meteorology

### Teaching

I approach teaching and learning as a collaborative process between
teachers and students.

-   [Git for course deployment and
    websites](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/) - a
    workshop on how to use [Github](https://github.com/) as a tool to:
    1.  deploy course websites and materials, and
    2.  allow students, professors, and TAs to collaborate on improving
        course materials.

    I put this together with funding and support from Columbia\'s
    [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.columbia.edu/).

### Resources (mostly for fellow students)

-   [Writing](writing.html)
-   [EEE Graduate Student Resources](eaee-ta-resources.html) -
    department specific documentation provided by graduate students, for
    graduate students (and TAs)
