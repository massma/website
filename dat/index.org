** Adam Massmann's home

   I am a Ph.D. student in environmental engineering, advised by
   [[https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people/pierre-gentine][Pierre Gentine]] at Columbia University. I study *human-land-climate
   interactions* by merging *physical or conceptual models* with
   *observational data*.

*** Research
    - [[file:vpd-et.html][Does atmospheric drying increase or reduce evapotranspiration?]]
    - Previous: [[file:masters-research.html][Master's Research (UAlbany)]] in mesoscale meteorology

*** Teaching

    I approach teaching and learning as a collaborative process
    between teachers and students.

    - [[https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/][Git for course deployment and websites]] - a workshop on how to
      use [[https://github.com/][Github]] as a tool to deploy course websites and materials and
      allow students, professors, and TAs to collaborate on improving
      course materials. I put this together with funding and support from
      Columbia's [[https://ctl.columbia.edu/][Center for Teaching and Learning]].

*** Resources (mostly for fellow students)
